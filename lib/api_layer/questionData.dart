    'questionAnswer':
        'Digital cable is a type of cable transmission that offers better picture and sound quality, more channels and an on-screen guide than traditional analog (basic) cable. Because digital channels are more highly compressed than analog channels more channels can be broadcast in the same space. To receive digital cable channels a digital receiver [STB] is required. Analog television service is the traditional method of transmitting TV signals and has been the standard broadcast technology since the inception of television.'

    'questionAnswer':
        'There are two types of digital TV that you’ll encounter when watching TV – standard definition (SD) and high definition (HD). Standard definition is a lower form of digital TV. The aspect ratio for SD TV is 4:3, which is more square-like in appearance. That’s why when watching SD images on a HDTV you’ll get either a stretched picture or a picture with black bars on the side of the screen. High definition is the highest form of digital TV. The aspect ratio for HD is 16:9, which is rectangular like a movie theater screen. That’s why when watching HD images on an analog or SDTV that you’ll get black bars on the top and bottom of the screen.'

    'questionTitle': 'What Is High Definition Television (HDTV)?',
    'questionAnswer':
        'High Definition Television is a type of digital television that uses extremely high-resolution imagery with enhanced audio (such as Dolby Digital) to provide a movie-theater like viewing experience. The number of horizontal lines (made of pixels) displayed on the TV screen determines the TV resolution. High-definition TVs have 720 horizontal lines or more, as compared to traditional analog televisions, which have 480 horizontal lines. There is also a difference in the screen format (or aspect ratio) that gives high-definition TVs the ability to display a wide screen format (or 16:9 aspect ratio) while traditional TVs utilize a 4:3 aspect ratio. High-definition TVs can be purchased at local electronics stores and look similar to traditional analog televisions, but provide a picture that is six times sharper than an analog TV set.'

    'questionAnswer':
        'Understanding the Volume Difference:Television that is broadcast in high definition, uses Dolby 5.1 audio, to deliver high-quality sound. This feature utilizes six different audio channels in order to create the clear audio, which can be heard on these channels. Ensuring that the sound from each of these audio channels is in balance, results in a lower volume.Solutions-Here are some solutions for avoiding the blast of volume, which is common when changing the channel from SD to HD-Here are some solutions for avoiding the blast of volume, which is common when changing the channel from SD to HD- Another option is dynamic range compression (DRC). This option compresses the dynamic range of the audio signal to reduce the volume when the sound gets loud. Enabling this option depends upon the TV model, but it is common for DRC settings to be found on the TV menu. Viewers can contact the television manufacturer to learn more about DRC.Point to Remember-DRC is not just useful for reducing the volume when switching from SD to HD channels. This technology can keep the volume of those loud commercials down to enhance the overall viewing experience. '

    'questionTitle': 'What Is The Difference Between DTV And HDTV Signals??',
    'questionAnswer':
        'DTV (or Digital Television) is a type of television signal. HDTV (High Definition Television) is the highest quality of digital signals, offering better resolution and sound than Standard Definition TV (SDTV) signals. Channels and programs broadcast in SD signals can be watched on any television if you have one of our digital receivers. Programs and channels broadcast in HD can be watched if you have an HDTV television and an HD receiver. HDTV provides pictures with several times the clarity of DVDs and over 5 times the resolution of a regular television picture. HDTV is the largest leap in TV technology since color TV replaced black and white. Color: HDTV provides vivid color, including a wide range of hues without any bleeding at the edges of the image. Clarity/Detail: HDTV images are as detailed as a high-resolution photograph. It is like looking through a window. When watching a TV program in HD, you will be amazed at the sharpness of the picture. You can even pick up the specks of different colors in an actor’s eyes, or see individual sweat drops on a football player–details you could never see through regular television. Wide-screen: HDTV allows you to view content in a 16:9 wide-screen format, the same format used in movie theatres. Current TVs use a4:3 image, which cuts pictures off because it forces a wide image into a narrow space. Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound: All HDTV programming can provide 5.1 channel Dolby Digital Surround Sound–just like true theatre sound.'

        'What Is DVI? What Is HDCP? What Is HDMI? What Is Aspect Ratio?',
    'questionAnswer':
        'DVI (Digital Visual Interface): an all digital link between a video/audio source such as an HDTV receiver and a display device such as an HDTV. The DVI link provides an uncompressed digital stream at rates up to 5 Gbps between the two devices. The DVI link does not contain audio, so audio is still needed to be connected from the receiver to the HDTV or home theater system. One advantage of DVI is that the link allows graphics to be sent along the link as well. This allows the user interface from the digital receiver to be displayed on the HDTV. HDCP (High-Bandwidth Digital Content Protection): HDCP is the copy protection standard that is tied to DVI. HDMI (High-Definition Multimedia Interface): HDMI is the next generation of DVI. The main difference between HDMI and DVI 1.0 is that HDMI adds audio to the DVI link and is a smaller connector. The HDMI interface will be backwards compatible to the DVI 1.0 interface, meaning that you can connect a set-top to an HDTV, where one has DVI 1.0 and the other has HDMI. Most new HDTVs have HDMI connections. Those that don’t most likely are equipped with DVI, which is backwards compatible. Aspect ratio: the width of a picture relative to its height. The most common aspect ratios are 4:3 and 16:9. The majority of current analog and standard definition transmissions are 4:3. Virtually all high definition transmissions are in 16:9 aspect ratio, which is similar to the aspect ratio of a movie screen.'

    'questionTitle': 'What Is 480i, 720p, 1080i And 1080p?',
    'questionAnswer':
        'Each of the numbers – 1080, 720, and 480 – indicates the number of vertical lines of resolution present in a video signal or that a television is capable of displaying. For example, a 1080p video signal has 1080 lines of information from the top to the bottom of the image. The more lines used to describe the image, the clearer and “higher-quality” it is. An HDTV can have as many as 1,080 lines of resolution compared to the 480 active line maximum seen on a traditional analog TV. While a traditional analog TV has a total of about 200,000 pixels, a high definition can have up to 10x as many, or 2 million pixels! The letters ‘i’ and ‘p’ stand for ‘interlaced’ and ‘progressive’. Interlaced scanning is a broadcast process used in TV sets in which half the lines are transmitted as one field and the other half is transmitted as the second field. These two fields are displayed sequentially to form an image. Progressive scanning is typically used by computer monitors. This scanning process paints all the horizontal scan lines on the screen at one time. Progressive scanning is also used for high definition broadcasts and DVD players.'
